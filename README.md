# Cars Price Prediction

This project was developed as part of an activity in the Statistics course of the Data Science Specialization program at UTFPR Curitiba.

The aim of this analysis is to use data from a diverse selection of used cars and their resale prices to fit a **multiple linear regression model** capable of predicting potential prices for other vehicles based on their characteristics. Such a model can assist buyers and sellers in pricing cars according to market values.
